C++   source   files   will   be   compiled   to   assembly   language.   
The   assembly   languageinstructions generated will be classified into different types of instructions. 
Profiles showing thedistribution of the assembly language instructions according to type will then be generated.

Gather at least three of the largest or longest C++ source files you have written. C
ompile each source file to assembly language. 
Open the assembly language file generatedand classify the assembly language instructions  
into at least three categories: move instructions,arithmetic/logic instructions and jump instructions. 
Additional categories may be used. Take note ofthe   total   number   of   instructions   classified   and   the   total   numbers   of   each   kind.   
Discard   labels,comments and lines of assembly code that only serve to define segments, constants, strings andsimilar   constructs.   
Generate   tables,   graphs   or   charts   showing   the   distribution   of   the   kinds   ofinstructions according to percentages of the total number of instructions.
Also   generate   tables,   graphs   or   charts   showing   the   aggregate   statistics   of   the   assemblylanguage instructions in all files generated.
Compare and contrast the various distributions generated.Submit the C++ source files used, the assembly language source files generated from themand the data and notes generated from the assembly language files.
